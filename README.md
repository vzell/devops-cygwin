# DevOps: Setup and Running Everything under Cygwin on Windows

The main goal of this project is to run the different DevOps related toolchains
under *Cygwin*. It makes it possible to also use tools like *Ansible* which are not
supported on Windows.

*Cygwin* is a Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Microsoft
Windows. Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data,
and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the
Unix-like environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from
the Cygwin environment, as well as to use Cygwin tools and applications within
the Windows operating context.

Cygwin consists of two parts: a dynamic-link library (DLL) as an API
compatibility layer in the form of a C standard library providing a substantial
part of the POSIX API functionality, and an extensive collection of software
tools and applications that provide a Unix-like look and feel.
